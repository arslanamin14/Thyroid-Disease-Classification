Thyroid Disease Classification - A Comparative analysis of Random Forest, XGBoost, Ensemble Learning and Neural Networks

1. Firstly an EDA was performed, in which dataset and its features were explored by multiple aspects.
2. Then, performance of multiple ML models with and without using class balance (Using SMOTE), was compared.
3. Lastly feature importance was analyzed using LIME and SHAP methods.
